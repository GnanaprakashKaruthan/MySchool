		<p>I am extremely honored to share about our school, the great
			building, has successfully completed 25 years of its teaching. In
			this journey school has created many bright students who are working
			in different fields in country today, with their best possible
			capabilities. Our school has countless achievements to be listed.</p>

		<p>I started studying in this school from the very beginning. This
			is the first school where I stepped in. In fact, this school has
			special relationship with my family. My sisters, family members and
			relatives, most of them, have been taught and trained by this school.
			This school is very special for me that it has made me what I am
			today. I have learned a lot of things from here that would go long
			with me for the rest of my life.</p>

		<p>The schools are made by the teachers with an efficient team
			management, dedication, sincerity of purpose and love for teaching. I
			am very proud of my school that it has one of the best experienced
			teachers. All of my school teachers and other members are very
			passionate. In fact, they have worked very hard to make this school
			one of the best place of education in our entire area.</p>

		<p>The best school is one where the teachers understand what is
			needed in education for a student. The teachers of this school are
			very sincere and cooperative with the students. They know how to keep
			a balance between study and other activities. They keep their
			students active and alert in both curricular and non curricular
			activities. That's why our school has been regularly featured in top
			award winning schools in both sports and academic areas.</p>

		<p>My school is like the second home of a student. It teaches you
			the good manners and good habits in your life. My school is an ideal
			school that prepares a student thoroughly. It emphasizes on
			discipline, dedication, sincerity and hard work. My school provides
			the best environment for the grooming of a student. It nurtures the
			best ever qualities of self confidence, motivation and passion among
			students.</p>

		<p>The best schools have always the best results. We all should
			feel proud on our school because it has prepared the best minds. It
			has created many successful persons, engineers, doctors, lawyers,
			businessman, IT professionals, Civil service officers etc. The
			schools are like real assets of a nation and the nations are made
			great with the strongest institutions.</p>

		<p>we all are having very wonderful days of learning and
			experiencing things at school. Every year many of our friends leave
			this school by completing their education here. We all will be
			replaced by the other students here. The best time always passes
			speedily. We may not have another opportunity to be the part of such
			a prestigious institute in our life again. We need to try our best to
			maximize our learning and understanding from this wonderful
			institute.</p>
